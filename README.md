## This is a project done during an IT course and it shows how basic HTML5 and CSS3 knowledge can make great, functional web pages 
### It has a responsive interface, implementing self-built grids and navigation bars.  

In the future, i'd like to improve this project to add JS, Bootstrap and other technologies and frameworks I've learnt and which are displayed through my other repositories
